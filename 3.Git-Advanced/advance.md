# Git Workflow Concepts

This repository serves as a guide to understanding various Git workflow concepts. Below are explanations of key concepts along with useful links for further reading.

## 1. Rebasing

Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It's commonly used to maintain a linear project history, making it easier to understand changes over time. For a detailed understanding and usage of rebasing, refer to the following resource:

## 2. Cherry Picking

Cherry picking involves selecting specific commits from one branch and applying them to another branch. This is useful when you want to bring in specific changes without merging entire branches. Learn more about cherry picking from:

## 3. Squashing

Squashing is the process of combining multiple commits into a single, coherent commit. It helps in simplifying commit history, especially before merging branches or creating pull requests. For a step-by-step guide on squashing commits, check out:

## 4. Stashing

Stashing allows you to temporarily store changes that are not ready to be committed, allowing you to switch branches without committing incomplete work. This is helpful when you need to quickly switch contexts without losing your changes. Learn more about stashing here:

## 5. Submodule

Git Submodules allow you to include other Git repositories within your own repository as a submodule. This is useful for managing dependencies or including external projects within your project. To understand how to work with submodules, refer to:

## 6. Subtree

Git Subtree is similar to Git Submodule but allows you to insert a separate Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This can be useful for managing projects that need to be kept together in a single repository. Learn more about Git Subtree from:
